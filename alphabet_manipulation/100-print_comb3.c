//Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
//
//Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
//The two digits must be different
//01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
//Print only the smallest combination of two digits
//Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
//You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
//You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
//You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
//All your code should be in the main function
